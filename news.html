        <h1>Libyan rivals 'co-ordinating over flood relief'</h1>
        <p class="first">The two rival governments in Libya are co-ordinating relief efforts for flood victims, the UN has said.</p>
        <p>More than 5,300 people died after two dam bursts brought devastating floods to the eastern city of Derna.       </p>    
        <p>Derna's mayor, Abdulmenam al-Ghaithi said that number could reach as high as 20,000, based on the extent of the area of the city that was destroyed.    </p>
        <p>Another official from Tobruk-based eastern government said the sea was "constantly dumping dozens of bodies"    </p>
        <p>"The estimated the number of deaths in the city could reach between 18,000 to 20,000, based on the number of buildings in the districts destroyed by the flood," Mr Ghaithi told the Saudi-owned television station Al Arabiya.    </p>
